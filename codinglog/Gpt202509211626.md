# Session Log 2025-09-21 16:26

## Prompt
- Follow logging requirements from `AGENTS.md`.
- User request: "generate code".

## Actions
- Ran `date +%Y%m%d%H%M` to obtain timestamp for log filename.
- Created `codinglog` directory for session logs.

## Notes
- Awaiting clarification on the specific code to generate.

## New Prompt
- "I just start this project. Please create new codes \"Blazor Server application with DuckDB\""

## Additional Actions
- Ran `ls` to inspect repository contents.

## Step 1 Actions
- Ran `dotnet new list blazor` to confirm available templates.
- Created solution via `dotnet new sln -n BlazorDuck`.
- Scaffolded Blazor Server project using `dotnet new blazor -n BlazorDuck.Web --interactivity Server`.
- Added project to solution with `dotnet sln BlazorDuck.sln add BlazorDuck.Web/BlazorDuck.Web.csproj`.

## Implementation Actions
- Created data directory and copied `sendgrid.parquet` into `BlazorDuck.Web/wwwroot/data/`.
- Added configuration, models, and services to support DuckDB WASM querying.
- Authored JavaScript interop module `wwwroot/js/duckdbInterop.js`.
- Updated Blazor components (`Home.razor`, navigation) for the DuckDB explorer UI.
- Configured application services via `Program.cs` and updated `appsettings.json`.

## Validation
- Ran `dotnet format BlazorDuck.sln` with sandbox escalation to satisfy formatting requirement.
- Executed `dotnet build BlazorDuck.sln`; build succeeded with expected NU1900 vulnerability lookup warnings (offline environment).

## Error Reproduction
- Observed runtime failure: dynamic port binding on `localhost:0` not supported during `dotnet run`.

## Fix
- Updated `BlazorDuck.Web/Properties/launchSettings.json` to bind explicitly to `http://localhost:5000` and `https://localhost:5001`.

## Validation Attempt
- `dotnet run --project BlazorDuck.Web/BlazorDuck.Web.csproj` now fails with `SocketException (13): Permission denied` when binding to port 5000; likely due to sandbox not permitting listening sockets. Application configuration updated successfully.

## Runtime Issue
- Browser console reported failure loading `http://localhost:5000/duckdb/duckdb-browser.mjs`.
- Root cause: DuckDB WASM bundle files are not present under `wwwroot/duckdb/`.

## Guidance
- Download DuckDB WASM assets (e.g., from https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb-wasm/releases) that match the desired version.
- Place `duckdb-browser.mjs`, `duckdb-browser.worker.js`, `duckdb.worker.js`, and `duckdb.wasm` in `BlazorDuck.Web/wwwroot/duckdb/`.
- Restart the application after copying the files.

## Asset Automation
- Added MSBuild target in `BlazorDuck.Web.csproj` to download DuckDB WASM and Apache Arrow bundles from jsDelivr into `wwwroot` at build time.
- Updated DuckDB configuration defaults (`DuckDbWasmOptions`, `appsettings.json`) to use the EH bundle file names.
- Adjusted `wwwroot/js/duckdbInterop.js` to instantiate DuckDB with the new bundle layout and handle optional pthread workers.
- Documented automatic downloads in `wwwroot/duckdb/README.txt`.

## Validation
- `dotnet format BlazorDuck.sln` (elevated) to keep C# formatting consistent.
- `dotnet build BlazorDuck.sln` failed due to sandboxed network; reran with `/p:NoDuckDbDownload=true` to skip downloads and confirm build succeeds.
