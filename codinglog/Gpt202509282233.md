# Session Log

## Prompts
- System: You are ChatGPT ...
- Developer: Instructions about Codex CLI, planning, etc.
- User: Task to move DuckDB download to npm build and log requirements.

## Actions
- 22:33: Retrieved timestamp for log file naming.
- 22:33: Created this log file per instructions.
- 22:33: Reviewed `BlazorDuck.Web/BlazorDuck.Web.csproj` to understand current DuckDB download target.
- 22:34: Inspected DuckDb bundle configuration (`package.json`, `vite.config.mjs`) and existing assets under `wwwroot/duckdb`.
- 22:36: Replaced MSBuild download target with asset verification in `BlazorDuck.Web/BlazorDuck.Web.csproj`.
- 22:37: Updated `DuckDbBundle/vite.config.mjs` to download DuckDB assets during `npm run build`.
- 22:38: Refreshed documentation in `BlazorDuck.Web/wwwroot/duckdb/README.txt` and top-level `README.md` to reflect the new workflow.
- 22:39: Ran `dotnet format --no-restore` with elevated permissions due to sandbox restrictions.
- 22:40: Attempted `dotnet run --project BlazorDuck.Web/BlazorDuck.Web.csproj` (fails: sandbox prevents binding to localhost). Also retried with custom URL and saw same restriction.
- 22:42: Adjusted `DuckDbBundle/vite.config.mjs` to read installed DuckDB version via filesystem instead of package exports.
- 22:43: `npm run build` failed inside sandbox because CDN download is blocked (restricted network).
