# Prompt
- Initial request: migrate the DuckDbBundle Vite app to Vue 3, move the result rendering from `Home.razor` into Vue, and expose a div host for embedding the Vue app from Blazor.
- Follow-up request: update the implementation to use TypeScript.

# Actions
- Added Vue 3 dependency and plugin, created a Vue component for query results, and exposed an embeddable `createResultApp` API from the DuckDb bundle.
- Refactored `Home.razor` to delegate result rendering to the Vue bundle via JS interop, added helper methods to copy immutable arrays, and ensured lifecycle cleanup.
- Migrated the DuckDb bundle source to TypeScript, introduced shared type definitions, configured Vite and TypeScript settings, and updated the build to emit the same bundle artifact.
- Ran `npm install` and `npm run build` to confirm the Vue/TypeScript bundle builds successfully.
- Attempted `dotnet run --project BlazorDuck.Web/BlazorDuck.Web.csproj`, but sandbox networking restrictions prevented binding to `http://localhost:5000`.
- Attempted `dotnet format --no-restore`; sandbox restrictions on named pipes caused the command to fail.
