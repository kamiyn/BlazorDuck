# Prompt
- DuckDbBundle/vite.config.mjs に ブラウザでデバッグするため ソースコードのコピーと map ファイル追加

# Actions
- Updated `DuckDbBundle/vite.config.mjs` to resolve paths via `fileURLToPath`, enable build sourcemaps, and add a post-build plugin that copies the `src` directory into the bundled output for browser debugging.
- Attempted to run `dotnet format` (with `--no-restore` and `MSBUILDDISABLENODEREUSE=1`) but the sandbox denied named pipe access, so formatting could not complete.
- Attempted `dotnet restore` to unblock formatting, but it was denied by the sandbox.
- Ran `dotnet run --project BlazorDuck.Web/BlazorDuck.Web.csproj --no-restore` (with and without custom URLs); Kestrel failed to bind because socket creation is blocked in the sandbox environment.

# Results
- Source copy plugin and sourcemap generation are now part of the Vite build pipeline.
- Required validation commands were attempted, but sandbox restrictions prevented them from completing successfully.
