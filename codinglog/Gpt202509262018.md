# Prompt
- Update architecture so Blazor only supplies the selected parquet file name and SQL, delegating DuckDB querying and result rendering entirely to the Vue 3 app.

# Actions
- Changed the Vue bundle handle to own the full query flow: validate inputs, execute DuckDB queries, and update reactive state; exposed new `runQuery`/`reset` API and tightened TypeScript typings.
- Removed the Blazor `DuckDbQueryService`, passed DuckDB WASM configuration directly when mounting the Vue app, and simplified `Home.razor` to call the new handle methods.
- Deleted the obsolete service registration, rebuilt the Vite bundle (`npm run build`), and attempted `dotnet run` (denied binding to localhost) and `dotnet format --no-restore` (sandbox pipe restriction).
